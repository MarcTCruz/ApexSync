Why ApexSync?
 
1.Apexsandbox.io is unable to retain the solved codes when the browser or sandbox was changed. This extension will address the drawback of the website with the help of GitHub.
Simply use the retrieved feature to access your completed solutions in any browser or sandbox.

2. Moreover, pushing code manually to GitHub from ApexSandbox.io is very time-consuming. Just solve the problems and ApexSync will automate the syncing process for you without any extra effort.



#Features:

#I will soon publish the source code.Â
